Hello, Welcome to GitHub

git testing...!

git add . , git add --all               -add the changes to the git 
git commit -m " enter the message "     - includes the changes to the commit 
git push                                -  upload the changes that made to the github remote repo

Branch
-------
git branch <enter the branch name>     - create a new  branch
git checkout <branch name>              - switch to the mentioned branch name


Merge 
------
    first switch to the branch, from where we want to merge

  git merge <name of the branch to merge >  -  to merge the changes , it is called ( fast-forward Merge ).
  
git diff - to know the difference 


Conflict
--------
         Suppose there are 2 branches and one text file or html file. 
         Then make  changes to that  file from both the  different branches and commit it, 
         After that when we try to merge any of the branch then there will be conflict.
         fix it manually
